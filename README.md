# teras_app
monitor rice availability in the upcoming year. With this app, the aim is to control rice availability and preempt any future shortages by taking early mitigative measures.
#Modelling the Data
predicting whether a province has a surplus or deficit in rice availability involves four indicators: the population dataset in Indonesia, rice production datasets in Indonesia, rice consumption datasets in Indonesia, and the value of milled dry grain conversion. Preprocessing is done to consolidate these indicators into a single historical value of rice availability. Subsequently, modeling is conducted using TensorFlow to generate predicted values for the future.
#Features
1.  Rice Availability Prediction: The implementation of machine learning in this applies in predicting rice availability in each Indonesian province. This is visualized through mapping and a leaderboard within the application.
2.  Farmer's Forum: TeRas provides a feature for farmers or users to share food-related information, aiming to build a community in the agricultural sector (This feature is still on the development stage).
